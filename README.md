This project delivers a professional and responsive website for a barber shop and beauty salon, "Fama Barber Shop & Beauty Salon" located in Denton, TX. The site is designed to provide essential information to potential customers, including services offered, a gallery of work, and contact details.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The website is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Intuitive Navigation: A sticky header with clear navigation links allows users to easily access different sections of the website, including About, Services, Gallery, and Contact. A mobile-friendly toggle menu is implemented for seamless navigation on smaller screens.
Hero Section: The prominent hero section immediately introduces the salon, highlights its strong customer rating (4.6 stars based on 116+ reviews), and provides a direct call-to-action to call the business.
Services Showcase: A dedicated section displays the barber shop's offerings, such as men's haircuts, traditional shaves, beard trims & shaping, and styling & coloring, presented in a visually appealing grid format.
Gallery: A responsive image gallery showcases the salon's work and interior, providing potential clients with a visual representation of the services and atmosphere.
Contact Information & Location: Detailed contact information, including address, phone number, and operating status, is provided. An embedded Google Map helps users easily locate the salon and get directions.
Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons: Strategically placed CTA buttons encourage user engagement, facilitating direct calls and enabling users to get directions or read reviews.
Smooth Scrolling: Implemented JavaScript ensures a smooth scrolling experience when navigating between sections via the header links.
Dynamic Year in Footer: The copyright year in the footer is automatically updated using JavaScript, ensuring it's always current.
Technologies Used:
